This file contains a VBA code to maintain the Locators on another automation project.
This file was created duo to endless changes to the locators ID and XPath on the project that cause us to work for hours to replace them.
Because all of those changes and endless coversations I (GuyElm) decided to create a excel manage file of all the locators we have on our project to be able to look after all the changes the developers made.
This VBA code will log any changes made by the QA team that updates its Tables.
the log runs on a specific column in each tab and log it into a ChangeLog tab that will give information on the changes that were made (what change was made, whom did the change, at what time did the change made, the table that the change was made in, etc)
All the changes are typo responsive and will trigger the code appon any change that is made on the responsive tabs

the code is hidden and blocked by a password.
the password will be given only to the persons i want to give it to them

this code was made by GuyElm - 16.05.24
